#this is how you make a comment

2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!
'''
a=2
b=5
#() means right answer
print(b/a)                  #2.5
print(b//a)                 #2
print(b**a)                 #25
print(b%a)                  #0(1)
#print(a+B)  B is not identified so it causes an error
print(type(42))             #int
print(type(42.0))           #float
print(type("C3PO"))         #str
print(type(True))           #boollian
