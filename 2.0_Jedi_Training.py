#1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.

#whats up gamers



#2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following.
#What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!
#a=2
#b=5
#c= (42)
#print(c)
#b//a                = 2
#b**a                = 25
#b%a                 =1
#a+B                 = B is not defined,need to put lower case b
#type(42)            = 42
#type(42.0)          = 42.0
#type("C3PO")        = C3PO is not defined need to defined what it is
#type(True)          = true


#3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
#into the Python Console Window?

#a=2
#a*=10
#a/=2
#a+=12
#a-=7
#print(type(a))
#a             =15.0
#type(a)       =float


#4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!

#x=4
#y=5

#a = 3*(x+y)
#print(a)


#5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
print(ave)
