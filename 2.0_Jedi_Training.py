1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.
'''
#I can write a single line comment with a hashtag this this

a=2
b=5
print(b/a)
print(b//a)
print(b**a)
print(b%a)
#print(a+B)Name Error

print(type(42))
print(type(42.0))
print(type("C3PO"))
print(type(True))

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
print(a)
print(type(a))

x,y = (4,5)
a = 3*(x + y)
print(a)

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
print(ave)

2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!

b/a                 = 2.5
b//a                = 2
b**a                = 25
b%a                 = 1
a+B                 = Name Error: name 'B' is not defined - since the b is capitalized the program doesn't
                    know what it is because it was never defined only lowercase b is defined
type(42)            = <class 'int'>
type(42.0)          = <class 'float'>
type("C3PO")        = <class 'string'>
type(True)          = <class 'bool'>


3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a             = 15.0
type(a)       = <class 'float'>


4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!

x,y = (4,5)
a = 3*(x + y)
print(a)
27

5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
print(ave)
4.0
