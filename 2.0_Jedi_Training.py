1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.


2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!

b/a        2.5         =2.5
b//a        idk        =2
b**a         idk       =25
b%a         idk        =1
a+B             idk    =B is not defined
type(42)        idk    =int
type(42.0)      idk    =float
type("C3PO")     idk   =C3P0 is not defined
type(True)      idk    =bool


3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a             =15.0
type(a)       =float


4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!

x,y = (4,5)
a = 3(x + y) Parentheses doesn't mean multiplication. a = 3*x+3*y
a = 3*x+3*y


5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3 it doesn't divide the whole thing by 3, only the z
ave = x/3+y/3+z/3 = 4.0
