1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.
#like this

2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!

b/a                 = 2.5
b//a                = 2
b**a                = 25
b%a                 = 1
a+B                 = name 'B' is not defined
type(42)            = class int
type(42.0)          = class float
type("C3PO")        = class string
type(True)          = class bool


3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10         = 20
a/=2          = 10.0
a+=12         = -2.0
a-=7          = 3.0
a             = 2
type(a)       = integer
#

4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!

x,y = (4,5)
a = 3(x + y)
a

you cannot do 3(x + y), you need to do 3*(x+y) because python is not like traditional path

5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave

you need to put (x+y+z) in parentheses, otherwise it divides all of them by 3 and adds the sums instead of averaging
