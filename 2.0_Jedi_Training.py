1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.


2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!

b/a                 =2.5
b//a                =2
b**a                =25
b%a                 =1
a+B                 = there is an error because the B is a capital letter and is not defined.
type(42)            =<class 'int'>
type(42.0)          =float
type("C3PO")        = str
type(True)          =bool


3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a             =15.0
type(a)       =15.0


4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!

x,y = (4,5)
a = 3(x + y)
a
the mistake is that there is no coma between the x and the y


5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
so what i did was put ave=x+y+z and then did ave/3 and that gave me the average which is 4
